emacs-goodies-el (38.0) experimental; urgency=medium

  We are migrating emacs-goodies-el to use Debian's support for GNU Emacs's
  package.el, also known as "ELPA packages".  The main user visible changes are:

  - binary packages will be renamed to elpa-foo, where foo is the name of
    the addon; transitional packages are provided, so you will find the
    elpa- packages automatically installed when you upgrade; and

  - xemacs is no longer supported.

  We are also dropping some very old addons which we no longer consider to
  be maintained or maintainable.

  See /usr/share/doc/emacs-goodies-el/README.Debian.gz for the current
  status of the migration.
