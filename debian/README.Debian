Emacs Goodies for Debian
------------------------

  This file documents the status of Emacs addons that were
  previously part of the emacs-goodies-el package.  The Debian Emacsen
  team thanks Roland Mas, Peter S Galbraith, and Julian Gilbey for
  their many years of work on emacs-goodies-el.


Current Status
--------------

  In the following list, a prefix of "D" means "dropped", "E" means
"elpafied", and "T" means "transitioned to an actively maintained
alternative that has equivalent functionality".  Elpafied packages
have been declared as dependencies in debian/control and are named
something like "elpa-foo".  Transitioned usually means that the
functionality is now part of GNU Emacs.  Suggested alternatives to
Transitioned or Dropped packages are also found in this README.
Please note that these suggested packages are not automatically
installed.

  The emacs-goodies-el changelog contains the history and
justification for why a package was transitioned or dropped rather
than elpafied.  The changelog also contains references to RFP (Request
for Packaging) bugs; these bugs were filed for dropped packages that
someone on the Debian Emacsen team believes are useful, but that--due
to lack of interest, to third party software, or to niche hardware--no
one wants to maintain.


    ,----[ nice title ]
  E | boxquote.el allows the easy creation of boxes that look like this,
    | with a nice title and all.  Look for the M-x boxquote-* commands.
    `----

  T align-string.el provides M-x align-string and M-x align-all-strings,
    to align vertically the first occurrences of a regexp over several
    lines.
    - Use functions from GNU Emacs built-in align.el instead. eg:
      "M-x align-current", "C-u M-x align", et al.

  D all.el provides M-x all, a way to see all lines matching a regexp
    pattern in a special buffer.  Editing these lines in that buffer
    propagates the changes back to the original buffer.

  E apache-mode.el provides fontification when editing Apache
    configuration files.

  D ascii.el provides a way to display ASCII code on a window, that
    is, display in another window an ASCII table highlighting the
    current character code.

  D auto-fill-inhibit.el provides a finer grained control over
    auto-fill-mode activation.  Tu use it, simply load the file.  For
    instance, adding (load-library "auto-fill-inhibit") to your .emacs
    should do the trick.  You'll need to set the
    auto-fill-inhibit-list variable to an appropriate value.

  E bar-cursor.el allows you to change your cursor from a block to a
    vertical bar in insert mode, and back to a block in overwrite mode.
    Try M-x bar-cursor-mode.

  E bm.el provides visible, buffer local, bookmarks and the ability to
    jump forward and backward to the next bookmark.

  D browse-huge-tar.el allows you to browse large tar files without reading
    them into memory.  The trade off is memory usage vs. speed.

  E browse-kill-ring.el provides M-x browse-kill-ring.el, to, well, browse
    through your kill ring, perform searches on it, and insert items into
    a buffer.

  D button-lock.el is a minor mode which provides simple facilities to
    define clickable text based on regular expressions (used by maplev.el).

  T cfengine.el is an Emacs major-mode for editing cfengine scripts.
    - Built into GNU Emacs 23 and dropped from emacs-goodies-el 31.6.

  D clipper.el provides the M-x clipper-* commands to save strings of
    data and insert them afterwards.  Each string is labelled with a
    name, and can involve some basic template replacement.

  T color-theme.el changes the colors used within Emacs.  They are lots of
    themes to choose from.
    - The built-in alternative consists of cus-theme.el and custom.el.
      Custom themes were originally an XEmacs feature.  The Debian Emacsen
      Team packages some of the most popular ones, and "apt search elpa.*theme"
      will find them.
      "M-x load-theme" will load a specific theme.
      "M-x customize-themes" displays a selectable list of custom themes.
    - Please note, custom themes behave very differently than color themes
      when a theme is enabled or disabled.
    - The elpa-color-theme-modern package is a port of most of the
      color-themes to the new Emacs theme framework.  See RFP Bug #905246.
      -- Thanks to JÃ¶rg Sommer for this tip.
    - Elpa-color-theme-modern has been in Debian sid since 2019-11-13, and
      emacs-goodies began recommending it 2019-11-12.

  E csv-mode.el is a major mode for editing files of CSV type, which provides
    commands, key bindings and a menu to sort records by field, kill and yank
    columns, align and unalign fields, and transpose rows and columns.

  D ctypes.el can search through source files hunting down typedefs.
    When found, font-lock is informed and your source code will be
    even more beautifully colored than before.

  D coffee.el provides an Emacs interface to RFC2324-compliant coffee
    devices

  D dedicated.el allows you to toggle a window's "dedicated" flag.
    When a window is "dedicated", Emacs will not select files into
    that window.

  D df.el provides M-x df, to display in the mode line space left on
    devices.

  D dict.el is an Emacs interface to dict client.
    - Removed in emacs-goodies-el 36.0; Use dictionary-el instead.
      -- Copied from psg's entry in emacs-goodies-el.texi on this topic.

  E diminish.el provides M-x diminish, M-x diminish-undo and M-x
    diminished-modes.  Diminished modes are minor modes with a shorter or
    no modeline display.

  T dir-locals.el provides a functionality similar to the local
    variables defined in a file, but for an entire directory tree.
    Use This library implements such a scheme, controlled by the
    global minor mode `dir-locals-mode'.
    - The use of dir-locals.el via ".emacs-locals" files has overwhelmingly
      been replaced by the GNU Emacs built-in files.el via ".dir-locals.el"
      files.  That said, dropping dir-locals.el has the potential to
      inconvenience those who make extensive use of ".emacs-locals" files,
      and these users would probably appreciate it if someone stepped forward
      to maintain this package.  See RFP Bug #907284.

  D edit-env.el lets you display, edit, delete and add environment variables.

  D egocentric.el provides M-x egocentric-mode, a mode to highlight
    your name (or other keywords) in buffers.  If you use Gnus, you
    might want to add (add-hook 'gnus-article-prepare-hook
    'egocentric-mode) to your Gnus init file.

  E eproject.el is an extension that lets you group related files together as
    projects.  It aims to be as unobtrusive as possible -- no new files are
    created (or required to exist) on disk, and buffers that aren't a member
    of a project are not affected in any way.

  D ff-paths.el allows you to use C-x C-f normally most of the time,
    except that if the requested file doesn't exist, it is checked against
    a list of patterns for special paths to search for a file of the same
    name.  Use (require 'ff-paths) in your .emacs to activate it.

  D filladapt.el enhances the behavior of Emacs's fill functions by
    guessing the proper fill prefix in many contexts.  Emacs has a
    built-in adaptive fill mode but Filladapt is said to be much
    better.  Use `M-x filladapt-mode' to toggle Filladapt mode on/off
    in the current buffer.  Use 'turn-on-filladapt-mode in mode hooks.

  E folding.el provides a minor mode for folding (hiding) parts of the edited
    text or program.  Folding mode handles a document as a tree, where each
    branch is bounded by special markers `{{{' and `}}}'.

  D framepop.el makes temporary buffers such as *Help* or
    *Completions* appear in a separate frame which is easily dismissed
    when no longer needed.

  D floatbg.el provides M-x floatbg-mode, to slowly modify the background
    color of your Emacs.

  E graphviz-dot-mode.el provides a mode for editing files in the dot-language
    (www.graphviz.org and http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/).

  T highlight-beyond-fill-column.el highlights (with a face you
    choose) text that is beyond the fill-column, therefore providing a
    visual indication of where the fill-* functions would wrap the
    lines.  Enable it on a buffer using `M-x highlight-beyond-fill-column.'
    You may use that command in a hook (e.g. text-mode-hook).
    - The functionality of highlight-beyond-fill-column is now
      provided by the GNU Emacs builtin whitespace-line-column.

  T highlight-completion highlights completions in the minibuffer
    - The GNU Emacs built-in "M-x enriched-mode" might prove to be a
      suitable minimal replacement.
    - elpa-ivy, elpa-swiper, and elpa-helm provide similar functionality.

  T highlight-current-line.el highlights the line the cursor is in.
    Enable a buffer using the command `M-x highlight-current-line-minor-mode'.
    - The functionality of highlight-current-line.el is now provided by
      the GNU Emacs builtin hl-line-mode.

  D home-end.el provides some useful bindings for Home and End keys: hit the
    key once to go to the beginning/end of a line, hit it twice in a row to go
    to the beginning/end of the window, three times in a row goes to the
    beginning/end of the buffer.  To enable it, customize the variable
    `home-end-enable'.

  E htmlize.el provides many M-x htmlize-* commands that turn files,
    buffers, or region of font-lock colorized text into an HTML
    representation.

  E initsplit.el allows you to split Emacs customizations (set via M-x
    customize) into different files, based on the names of the
    variables.  To use it, just load the file in your .emacs: (load
    "initsplit").  Note that you *must* load each file that contains
    your various customizations from your .emacs.

  D joc-toggle-buffer.el provides M-x joc-toggle-buffer, a command that can be
    bound to a key in order to speed up the switching between two buffers.

  D joc-toggle-case.el provides a sophisticated (over-engineered?) set
    of functions to toggle the case of the character under point, with
    which you can emulate vi's ~ function.  Look for the M-x
    joc-toggle-case and M-x joc-toggle-case-* commands.

  D keydef.el provides the `keydef' macro for use in .emacs files (or
    similar).  It is an alternative (simpler) way to define keys, with
    kbd syntax.  You should read the doc in keydef.el, as it is not
    intended for interactive use.

  D keywiz.el drills you about Emacs key-bindings.  You're presented
    with the name of a command and the docstring, and then prompted
    for the correct key sequence.  You'll earn one point for each
    correct answer during the time limit.  Invoke with `M-x keywiz'.

  D lcomp.el adds useful keybindings to the completions buffer.

  D maplev.el is a major mode for Maple.

  D map-lines.el provides M-x map-lines, a command to iterate a given
    command over lines matching a regexp.

  E markdown-mode.el provides support for editing Markdown files. It
    provides syntax highlighting and basic element insertion commands.

  D marker-visit.el provides a simple way to navigate among marks in a
    buffer.  All the marks you've left while editing a buffer serve as
    bread crumb trails of areas in the buffer you've edited.  It is
    convenient to navigate back and forth among these marks in order.
    This file provides two methods to do just that, marker-visit-prev
    and marker-visit-next to visit the nearest mark in either
    direction.

  D matlab.el provides support for editing MATLAB dot-m files.  It
    automatically indents for block structures, line continuations
    (e.g., ...), and comments.  See RFP Bug #902739.

  T minibuf-electric.el eases minibuffer typing.  When you type "//", it
    clears the minibuffer back to the start, leaving only a single "/".
    When you type a "~", it does the similar, leaving only "~/".  This is
    nicer than having to explicitly erase the contents of the minibuffer.
    - This is now provided by GNU Emacs, in rfn-eshadow.el.
      Use this instead:
      ;;  (setq file-name-shadow-tty-properties '(invisible t))
      ;;  (file-name-shadow-mode 1)

  D minibuffer-complete-cycle.el makes `minibuffer-complete' select
    each of the possible completions in turn, inserting it into the
    minibuffer and highlighting it in the *Completions* buffer.

  D miniedit.el toggles minibuffer editing into a full text-mode buffer for
    easy multi-line editing of commands.

  E mutt-alias.el provides M-x mutt-alias-insert and M-x
    mutt-alias-lookup, two commands to lookup and insert the expansion
    of mutt mail aliases.

  E muttrc-mode.el provides muttrc-mode, a major mode to help the edition
    of Mutt configuration files.  To use it, either open a file named
    muttrc, or add a local variables section to the end of your file to
    specify the mode to be "muttrc".

  D obfusurl.el provides M-x obfuscate-url, a command that will
    obfuscate an URL under the cursor.

  D pack-windows.el resizes all windows vertically to display as much
    information as possible with the command `M-x pack-windows'.

  T perldoc.el provides an interface to the "perldoc" command in your
    Perl-mode or CPerl-mode buffers.  Use (require 'perldoc) in your
    .emacs to activate it, then place point over a word and press F1.
    - It's functionality is now largely provided by the GNU Emacs
      built-in cperl-perldoc.  Please file a bug if this isn't the case.

  D pp-c-l displays Control-l characters in a pretty way.

  E pod-mode.el provides support for editing Plain Old Documentation
    (Perl documentation) files.  It provides syntax highlighting.

  D projects.el provides M-x add-project, remove-project and
    list-projects, and introduces the concept of PROJECT ROOTS that allow
    the user to define logical project names and get abbreviated yet
    meaningful buffer names in the modeline.

  T protbuf.el provides M-x protect-buffer-from-kill-mode and M-x
    protect-process-buffer-from-kill-mode, two commands to protect
    buffers from being accidentally killed.
    - This functionality is now provided by M-x emacs-lock-mode.

  D protocols.el provides M-x protocols-lookup, to search for info in
    your /etc/protocols.

  D quack.el provides enhanced support for editing and running Scheme code in
    both the major and minor modes. It also provides easy access to online
    references for plt-scheme, books on Scheme, and SRFIs (Scheme Requests
    For Implementation). Because it invasively changes scheme-mode, it is not
    enabled by default. To enable it, customize the variable `quack-install'.

  E rfcview.el formats IETF RFCs for improved readability.

  D services.el provides M-x services-lookup, to search for info in
    your /etc/services.

  E session.el restores various variables (e.g., input histories) from
    your last session.  It also provides a menu containing recently
    changed/visited files and restores the places (e.g., point) of
    such a file when you revisit it.

  D setnu.el provides M-x setnu-mode, a vi-style line number mode.

  T shell-command.el is an enhancement for shell-command, enabling
    tab-completion of commands and dir/filenames within the
    shell-command input context.
    - Tab completion is now built into GNU EMACS
    - A fancy prompt can be configured thus:
      Old: (shell-command-make-prompt-string " [%w]%$ " default-directory)
      New: (format " [%s]$ " (directory-file-name
                              (abbreviate-file-name default-directory)))
      -- Thanks to Dima Kogan for this tip.

  D show-wspace.el is a minor mode to highlight whitespaces of various kinds.

  D slang-mode.el is a major mode for editing S-Lang files.

  D silly-mail.el provides M-x add-sm-* commands to add various headers to
    your email messages.

  T sys-apropos.el provides M-x sys-apropos, an interface to the
    "apropos" command.
    - This functionality is provided by "M-x man" and "M-x info", both of
      which are built into GNU Emacs.
    - Alternatively, use "M-x counsel-apropos" from the elpa-counsel package.

  E tabbar.el displays buffers as tabs in the header line, and
    provides commands to switch between them.  You can bind keys to
    M-x tabbar-forward and M-x tabbar-backward, and use these to
    quickly switch between buffers.  By default, tabbar-mode will
    group buffers into various groups, and only display one group at a
    time on the tabbar; you can change this by customizing tabbar.

  D tail.el provides the commands M-x tail-file and M-x tail-command,
    to follow the output of a command (or to follow a log file)
    without using any terminals.

  T tc.el provides a nice way to quote cited texts, with proper
    filling and attribution.  You can use it for instance by setting
    the cite function to 'trivial-cite: (setq message-cite-function
    'trivial-cite).
    - Gnus, built into GNU Emacs (gnus.el) provides this functionality.
      The two variables which can be configured to provide identical
      output to tc.el are:
        "message-citation-line-function"
        "message-citation-line-format"
    - To provide the same format as Kai Grossjohann's recipe in tc.el
        (setq message-cite-function 'trivial-cite
              tc-make-attribution 'tc-simple-attribution-kai)
      the following should now be used:
        (setq message-citation-line-function
              'message-insert-formatted-citation-line
              message-citation-line-format "On %e %B %Y %R %N, wrote:\n")
      -- Thanks to Gijs Hillenius for investigating and confirming this.
    - To actually insert the citation use "M-x message-insert-citation-line"
      This replaces "M-x trivial-cite".
    - See also "M-;", "string-insert-rectangle", and "mail-yank-prefix".

  D thinks.el provides cartoon-like think bubbles . o O ( like this ).
    Look for M-x thinks* commands.

  D tlc.el is a major mode for editing Target Language Compiler
    scripts.  It automatically indents the programming constructs.

  D tld.el provides M-x tld, for easy access to all those top-level
    domains you just can't remember, and to the corresponding countries.
    See RFP Bug #907284.

  D todoo.el provides M-x todoo and M-x todoo-mode, to conveniently edit
    TODO lists.

  D toggle-option.el provides M-x toggle-option, a command to rapidly
    toggle an option.  You should set the toggle-option-list variable
    to an appropriate value.

  D twiddle.el provides mode-line hacks.  There are two user commands of
    interest: twiddle-start and twiddle-compile.

  T under.el provides M-x underline-region, to underline a bit of text
    with ^ characters like this.
                      ^^^^^^^^^
    - "underline-region" is now a GNU Emacs built-in function.

  D upstart-mode.el is a major-mode for editing .upstart files.

  D xrdb-mode.el provides the xrdb-mode major mode, to help you editing X
    resource database files.  To use it, simple open a file named .Xdefaults,
    .Xenvironment, .Xresources or *.ad after having enabled it by customising
    `xrdb-mode-setup-auto-mode-alist'.
    - Any functionality xrdb-mode provides that isn't already provided by
      GNU Emacs built-in 'conf-mode' should probably be merged into
      conf-mode.el.  Without xrdb-mode, GNU Emacs opens these files using
      conf-xdefaults-mode.  See RFP Bug #902749
